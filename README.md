    <h1>Hi there, I'm Yelloface ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate game and web developer who loves exploring new
      stuff and doing fun projects. I've been programming as a
      hobby for more than 2 years, and I'm always looking for opportunities to
      learn and grow my skills.

      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p class="card1">
        I have experience working with C# and XNA using tModLoader API, and have
        developed a few Terraria mods, including Fading Light (Discontinued) and Yello's Small
        Additions (WIP), which are my own mods, as well as others like
        Aerovelence.

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <p class="card2">
        While I'm mainly focused on game development, I'm also exploring
        front-end web development. I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS and eager
        to expand my knowledge and experience in this area.
      </p>
